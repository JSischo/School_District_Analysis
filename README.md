# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
At the request of the school board, a re-analysis of standardized testing scores for the high schools in the district was conducted. This was the result of potential academic dishonesty. The school board would like the results of the previous analysis re-run once the 9th grade scores for reading and math at Thomas High School are removed.
## Results
Following is a comparison of the original school district analysis to the revised analysis once the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School have been removed.
